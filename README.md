# Simple Linear Regression 

Implementing uni-variate linear regression using the Eigen library in C++ 

### Command line parameters for running the program : 
1) The path of the csv file containing the data 
2) The learning rate for the gradient descent optimization routine 
3) The iterations for the optimization routine 

### The program returns the learned slope and intercept values in a file named "results.txt" in the same directory. 

### The Eigen Library can be used directly as a set of header files there is no need for linking.
